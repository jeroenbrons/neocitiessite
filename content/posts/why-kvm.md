# Why use KVM?

## Original reason
Due to the Big.Little-like architecture of the 12th gen core-CPU's most other hypervisors (like ESXi and Xen/XCP-NG) cannot use all cores. 

## Additional reason

Because Broadcom are evil Pieces of Shit and bought VMware and are doing everything in their power to just take every dime from VMware's customers and just fck up their (VMwares) products
